# React Tic-tac-toe
This is the tic-tac-toe game that is created during the tutorial [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Additional Features
In addition to the complete game and time travelling mechanics, I have also incorporated the additional features posed as a challenge:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

## Future Features
- [ ] Make the board bigger
- [ ] Add styling and animation to the board, status text, and move list panel
- [ ] Add webhooks and ability to send link to others so that you can play against each other in real-time
